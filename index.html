        <p class="lead mb-4">I want to provide a Happy Healthy Fitness for my clients, one that has stability and sustainability in both nutrition and fitness along with the happy healthy paths to getting to the client catered goals. I focus on the process and the philosophy that comes with what will keep my client happy in finding the best food and best fitness activities for them. My versatility comes from more than 3 years of personal training experience plus more than 8 years of research and self-experience in the field of fitness. This is not including my over 11 years of experience being in different sports that I took very seriously like MMA, wrestling, and soccer (or football), and the sports I played recreationally like basketball, football, and volleyball. I also have a year of experience teaching cardio kickboxing and circuit training. Experience is important but forming a relationship with the physical activities we like to do and foods we consume are much more important in being able to be and feel successful in our fitness journeys. My goal is to teach the proper forms and intricacies of fitness but more importantly the positivity and fun that can come in and out of good fitness and good food. My ultimate goal is to create no senses of dependency to the need of a ‚Äúsummer bod‚Äù or the need of a trainer and etc. The best version of ourselves is now, I will focus on showing my clients just that and to get through the journey together without the obsession of the goal. <br><br>

        My first passion or first love was with fitness and now the passions and paths divulge with my journey of pursuing a philosophy doctorate to become a professor. I want to support each path symbiotically, using my personal training to support myself through school and using philosophy to create a happy healthy fitness catered to the comfort of the client. Each person is different and often times we force to shape others and ourselves into the molds we desire. I want to find the intrinsic means of what a happy healthy fitness means to each person with the guidance of my experiences and professionality I‚Äôve built sturdily into my fitness and nutrition plans. Being a personal trainer is about understanding the subtleties in the body and my focus is 100% there and more but sustaining methods that work with everyone is more about the subtleties of the mind. Philosophy helps but focusing on the relationship between trainer-client and more importantly the direct relationship of the client and fitness/food is something I will observe as well. The more natural the relationship feels, the more room there is for growth and the sprouts of love for fitness and food that I would like to share the most in the end. <br><br>

        In conclusion, being a personal trainer has been a real privilege since I could see the lasting smiles of my clients, friends, and family who have chosen me to share my passion of fitness with them to join me on this journey. A journey doesn‚Äôt have a destination, the ‚Äúsummer bod‚Äù will come following a well-structured plan of being on a caloric deficit with fitness and nutrition that causes recomposition of losing fat and gaining muscle in place of it. I create the plans to be fully written out and explaining these topics and so on like protein synthesis, hypertrophy, and etc. I do not plan on making any half-baked fitness training, the process and the goal come into one ‚ÄúHappy Healthy Fitness‚Äù as my brand and promise.
